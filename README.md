# Card Matcher 

Card Matcher is a simply just a card matching game created with Vue.js. However, my goal wasn't to create a super complex game. Instead, I wanted to practice using css animations and state management in order to create an interesting user experience. A live version of the game can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://card-matcher.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
